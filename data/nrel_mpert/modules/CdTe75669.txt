source_notes:
  PV Module: CdTe75669
  Technology: Cadmium telluride
  Construction: Glass front/Glass back
  Deployment: Golden, CO - August 14, 2012 through September 24, 2013.
  History: Previously deployed for 52 months in Golden, CO
  Footnotes:
  - 1. Measured with a h.a.l.m. flash solar simulator
  - 2. Because of equipment limitations the maximum temperature for measurements was
    65°C instead of 75°C
  - 3. Measurements for 15°C and irradiances of 400, 600, 800, and 1000 W/m2 were
    not performed because of equipment limitations and infrequent occurrence of those
    conditions at the Cocoa, Eugene, and Golden sites.
  - 4. Raw Isc and Imp data corrected for temperature and irradiance using equation
    1 of  IEC 60891, raw Voc and Vmp corrected for temperature
  - '5. Uncertainty for crystalline silicon modules: Pm = ± 2.8%,  Isc = ± 2.3%, Imp
    = ± 2.3%, Voc = ± 0.3%, Vmp = ± 0.7%'
  - 6. With module open-circuited, preconditioning outdoor irradiance of 4.52 kWh/m2
    starting on 1/23/2014 at 1:00 PM and ending on 1/24/2014 at 9:35 AM
  - 7. Measurements on 12/16/2013 and before the preconditioning irradiance provided
    a Pm at STC of 65.4 W.
