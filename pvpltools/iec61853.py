    2. Evaluate the spectral factor using the functions:
        - convert_to_banded()
        - calc_spectral_factor()
    3. Estimate the operating temperature using the function:
        - faiman()

def convert_to_banded(spectral_reponse):

    Calculate the mean spectral reponse in standard wavelength bands.

    Parameters

    Notes
    -----
    The calculation method used here does not correspond precisely to the
    description in IEC 61853-3 [1] because the latter has inconsistencies.
    In particular:

    - the standard specifies integration limits of 300 and 4000 nm
    - the outer edges of the spectral bands in the standard's climate profiles
      are 306.8 and 4605.65 nm
    - the AM15G reference spectrum has irradiance values from 280 to 4000 nm
    - the AM15G reference spectrum must be integrated from 280 nm to
      infinity to reach the value of 1000 W/m2

    Spectral mismatch calculations require consistency in the limits.
    In this function all integration limits are set to the band edges
    306.8 and 3991, and the fixed value of 1000 W/m2 is replaced with the
    integral of the AM15 spectrum within these limits.  This implies
    that the last spectral band in the climate files is not used.

    The maximum difference in spectral factor between this simplification
    and multiple options for imposing a 4000 nm upper limit was
    found to be < 80 ppm.

class BilinearInterpolator(RegularGridInterpolator):

    Bilinear interpolation and extrapolation of a matrix of values.

    The values in the matrix are measurements at various combinations

    or at low irradiance/high temperature combinations.  These are filled in
    using the method described in [1], which ensures a continuous
    interpolation/extrapolation surface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix : pandas.DataFrame
        The row index of matrix must contain irradiance values and
        the column index of matrix must contain temperature values.
        The data in the dataframe can represent anything, but will

def martin_ruiz(aoi, a_r=0.16):
    r'''
    Determine the incidence angle modifier (IAM) using the Martin
    and Ruiz incident angle model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aoi : numeric, degrees
        The angle of incidence between the module normal vector and the
        sun-beam vector in degrees.

    a_r : numeric
        The angular losses coefficient described in equation 3 of [1]_.
        This is an empirical dimensionless parameter. Values of ``a_r`` are
        generally on the order of 0.08 to 0.25 for flat-plate PV modules.

    Returns
    -------
    iam : numeric
        The incident angle modifier(s)

    Notes
    -----
    `martin_ruiz` calculates the incidence angle modifier (IAM) as described in
    [1]_. The information required is the incident angle (AOI) and the angular
    losses coefficient (a_r). Note that [1]_ has a corrigendum [2]_ which
    clarifies a mix-up of 'alpha's and 'a's in the former.

    The incident angle modifier is defined as

    .. math::

       IAM = \frac{1 - \exp(-\cos(\frac{aoi}{a_r}))}
       {1 - \exp(\frac{-1}{a_r}}

    which is presented as :math:`AL(\alpha) = 1 - IAM` in equation 4 of [1]_,
    with :math:`\alpha` representing the angle of incidence AOI. Thus IAM = 1
    at AOI = 0, and IAM = 0 at AOI = 90.  This equation is only valid for
    -90 <= aoi <= 90, therefore `iam` is constrained to 0.0 outside this
    interval.

    c2 : float
        Second fitting parameter for the expressions that approximate the

    iam_ground : numeric

    Notes
    -----
    Sky and ground modifiers are complementary: iam_sky for tilt = 30 is
    equal to iam_ground for tilt = 180 - 30.  For vertical surfaces,
    tilt = 90, the two factors are equal.
